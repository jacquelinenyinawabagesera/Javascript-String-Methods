STRING METHODS

Project Overview

This project explores the use of string methods in JavaScript, focusing on manipulating and processing text data. It demonstrates how to extract, transform, and analyze strings using various string and array methods.

Tasks Completed

Extract Last Four Characters: Used the slice() method to extract the last four characters from a given string.

Insert String at Index: Demonstrated how to insert a string at a specific index using string concatenation.

Count Word Occurrences: Used the split() method to count occurrences of specific words in a string.

Find Words in Strings: Used the includes() method to check if a word exists within a string.

Convert Strings to Different Cases: Applied toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() methods to convert strings to lowercase and uppercase, respectively.

Additional Techniques
Array Methods: Used array methods  forEach() and map() to process and transform data.

Case Conversion: Used toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() to convert strings to different cases.

Key String Methods Used
slice(): Extracts a section of a string.

split(): Divides a string into an array of substrings.

includes(): Checks if a string contains a specified value.

toLowerCase(): Converts a string to lowercase.

toUpperCase(): Converts a string to uppercase.

Key Array Methods Used

forEach(): Executes a function for each element in an array.

map(): Creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element.
